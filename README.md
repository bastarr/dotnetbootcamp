# .NET Core Bootcamp
In this bootcamp we are going to focus on some core fundamentals of building applications using .NET Core.  We will break this training into multiple labs that will build on one another.  If at any point you get stuck in a specific lab, simply clone this repo and copy the files from the specific lab and continue on to the next lab.
### Prerequisites
Install the .NET Core 3.1 [SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) for your appropriate operating system   
  
Upon completing the installation, you should be able to run the following command to validate you have installed the SDK correctly.  It should display the installed version of the SDK i.e. 3.1.xxx
 ```
 dotnet --version
 ``` 
 ### Development Environment
 .NET Core is now a cross platform development and runtime platform.  There are many [tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) you can use develop applications for the .NET Core platform.  This lab will focus on using the command line and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
